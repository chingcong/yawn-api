# yawn-tornado

A lightweight web application boilerplate built using Tornado, designed for high-performance, non-blocking network applications. This project aims to provide a robust foundation for developing RESTful APIs and handling real-time web features with ease.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: built on the Tornado framework, allowing for non-blocking requests and efficient handling of concurrent connections.
- **Custom Error Handling**: utilizes Pydantic models for structured error responses.
- **Health Check**: built-in health check endpoints to monitor the status of the application and its dependencies.
- **Configuration Management**: easy configuration using environment variables and a dedicated configuration class.

## Installation

To set up yawn-tornado on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chingcong/yawn-tornado.git
   cd yawn-tornado
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pytohn3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your environment variables (e.g., database URL, secret keys).

## Usage

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

This will start the Tornado web server on the specified host and port (default: `localhost:8888`).

You can access the API at `http://localhost:8888`.

### Example API Call

To make a GET request to the health check endpoint, you can use `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/health
```

This will return a JSON response with the health status of the application.

## Configuration

Configuration options are managed via a `configs` folder. You can modify the `Config` class to adjust settings such as:

- **Server Settings**: number of workers, timeout settings.
- **Database Configuration**: connection strings and options.
- **Logging Level**: set the logging level for the application.

### Example `.env` File

```env
APP_ENV=dev
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
APP_SERVER_HOST=localhost
APP_SERVER_PORT=8000
```

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

### Health Check

- **GET /healthcheck**
  - Description: check the health of the application and its dependencies.
  - Response: JSON object with health status.

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "redis": "OK",
  "database": "OK",
  "application": {
    "name": "YAWN"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "env": "development"
}
```

## Error Handling

yawn-tornado uses Pydantic models to handle errors gracefully. The response format is consistent across different types of errors, ensuring easy integration for clients.

### Example Error Responses

1. **Internal Server Error**

   ```json
   {
     "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
     "status": 500,
     "message": "Internal server error"
   }
   ```

2. **Database Connection Error**

   ```json
   {
     "code": "DATABASE_CONNECTION_ERROR",
     "status": 500,
     "message": "Database connection error"
   }
   ```

## Logging

Logging is configured using Python's built-in logging module. The default logging level is set to `INFO`. You can customize the logging configuration in the `configs` module. Logs are written to the console and can be redirected to a file if needed.

### Example Log Output

```
INFO:__main__:Application started on http://localhost:8888
INFO:__main__:Health check passed: Redis and database are reachable.
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Add More Endpoints**: if your application has additional endpoints, describe them in the "Endpoints" section.
- **Usage Examples**: provide examples of how to use your endpoints with sample requests and responses.
- **Detailed Configuration Options**: if your application has many configurable options, consider adding a detailed explanation of each one.

Feel free to adjust any parts of this template to better fit your projectâ€™s needs! If you have more specific content or sections you want to add, let me know!
